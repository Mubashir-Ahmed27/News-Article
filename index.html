        <h1>🚨 The AI Boom: Revolution or Just Another Bubble?</h1>
        <p>AI isn’t just a tech trend anymore — it’s the pulse of the 2020s. But with the hype skyrocketing, South Asians (especially young professionals) are asking the real question: <strong>Is AI truly the future, or are we living inside an inflated bubble waiting to burst?</strong></p>

<p>Over the last decade, AI transformed from a research concept into a global economic engine — shaping search algorithms, medical diagnosis, financial predictions, and now creativity itself. The rise of generative tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Midjourney created a new wave of innovation, funding, and digital ambition. As Derek Thompson wrote, today’s AI era feels like “a new dawn and a recycled hype cycle at the same time.”</p>

<p>But the current landscape is divided. Some experts believe we’re entering a once-in-a-century revolution that will redefine work, education, and intelligence. Others argue the returns are still small, business models shaky, and expectations dangerously inflated. Yet one thing is undeniable: AI isn’t fantasy — it’s already powering education in India, health tech in Pakistan, and enterprise growth across South Asia at unprecedented speed.</p>

<p>The next decade will hinge on one element: trust. If companies build responsibly, innovate meaningfully, and prioritize human benefit, AI will evolve from hype to history. If not, the bubble could burst — not because the technology failed, but because our choices did.</p>

<p id="footer"><b>The question isn’t whether AI will change the world — it’s how South Asia will rise with it. <br>
Thank you for reading — the smartest move now is to stay curious, stay informed, and stay ready. </b></p>
